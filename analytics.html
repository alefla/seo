        <h1>Google Analytics Report Aug 18th-Sept 20th 2021</h1>
        <p>
          Based on
          <a href="analytics.pdf">GEO location google analytics report,</a>
          almost 92% of your Users are from California. California users also
          show the better percentage of session, bounce rate, page/ session and
          average session duration.
        </p>
        <p>The good things about this website:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Good number of session, users were back to visit this site.</li>
          <li>
            The bounce rate number is on average considering this website is not
            ecommerce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Page/session is pretty good as this website originally has 3 pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            Average session duration is not bad because this website is a very
            simple website with not much content.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Overall the data shows that this website is doing well, however there
          is always room for improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main idea of this website is for homework, which is why the users
          are in California, but it will be great if the audience could grow
          larger and maybe could make some revenues someday when we have enough
          website traffic. With the right SEO keywords that I use on each page,
          it will generate better google rank. The higher the rank the more
          possibility I will have more website traffic from different places.
          Also I need to provide more interesting and longer content that can be
          used by users from different places. Other improvement that I can do
          is on info page, instead of image I could replace with video. Besides
          it looks more interesting it also keeps the user stays instead of
          clicking hyperlink that refer to different websites(YouTube).
