        <p>
          Become a great web designer/web developer is my new goal. It is a new
          goal that surprised myself on how I like it so much now. I am an
          artist, and I thought I don't have any interest on website coding.
          They seem difficult and boring. Last semester I took Digital Skill
          Visual Media Art course and it cover very short html/css with a simple
          web design project. That very short time change my perspective about
          coding, specially html/css. The result is a piece of art too! They are
          beautiful and I still can be creative!
        </p>

        <p>
          After last semester done, my winter break filled with study of html
          and css whenever I had break within family and work. Everyday I
          learned something new from the internet. I am glad that there are so
          many resources and free online classes. Although sometimes can be
          confusing when reading blogs as they are can be an individual opinion.
          I found the best resource is
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >W3Schools</a
          >. It has become my favorite because they have my answer of all my
          questions regarding html/css and the best part is the actual simple
          example to run. We can edit and run it in their small editor box.
          That's great to play around so we can understand better.
        </p>

        <p id="clear">
          The best way to learn is by taking a formal education path and the
          internets are the additional as it is never enough to learn from one
          place. CCSF courses are free for San Francisco resident and it also
          has an online courses. I would recommend to check
          <a

            >CCSF Counselor</a
          >
          before signing up the class. Please make an appointment to see a
          counselor to get all the information that you need and some advice.

              Stack Overflow is an open community for anyone that codes. They
              help you get answers to your toughest coding questions, and people
              share their knowledge. Most of their questions are real and the
              answer came from people that actually try to help them. So it's
              more practical when we hit a problem rather than searching the
              answer in articles/blogs.
